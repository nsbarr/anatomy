10 of them. Mothers first question. Second toe tallest leans into third the nail used to cut into it. Bloody socks and infections and iodine.

The second and third toe share a stem. They cannot move independently. My fathers toes are the same as were his fathers before him. Used to call them the twin towers.

Callus under the right big toe. Nights I pick at it with the nail of the left big toe. Makes a pleasant scraping sound.

Scar from surgery on the left side of the left third toe. Melanoma. Grafted it with skin from my hip. 

Toes have wisps of hair on the knuckles. Pinky toe is hairless.

Thin vertical crack in the nail on right big toe. From dropping a toy piano on it.

Nails grow furiously. Sign of premature aging?
